You ask for a movie, show, or anime; an LLM agent scouts resources across your indexers, transfers the best match into your own 115 / Quark / 光鸭 drive, verifies what landed, and keeps tracking what's still missing.

![Mediary Scout — search a title, hit 获取, and the agent searches, transfers, and verifies it into your drive](docs/images/demo.gif)

> *Above: the read-only [live demo](https://demo.mediaryscout.app) — search → 获取 → the agent works through search, transfer, and verification.*

## Install

### Desktop app (recommended — easiest)

| Platform | Download | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [DMG → Releases](https://github.com/fancydirty/mediary-scout/releases/latest) | Signed + notarized, no Gatekeeper warning |
| **Windows** (x64) | [EXE installer → Releases](https://github.com/fancydirty/mediary-scout/releases/latest) | Unsigned — SmartScreen will prompt, click "run anyway" |

1. Download and install
2. Open the app
3. Go to **Settings** — connect a drive, add an LLM endpoint
4. Search a title, hit 获取 — that's it

No Docker, no Postgres, no terminal. The app bundles its own SQLite data layer and runs the full engine inside an Electron shell.

Every release is machine-verified before it ships: CI installs the freshly-built Windows package on a clean runner, boots the real app, and requires an HTTP 200 health response, while the macOS build must pass native-ABI verification, signing, and notarization. Both platforms are published together in a single final step — if either gate fails, neither asset is uploaded, so a broken build can't reach the Releases page.

### Docker (power users — always-on server)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # optional — most config can be set in the UI
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://<host>:3000` and configure in **Settings**. Full walkthrough: **[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md)**.

> 🇨🇳 **Can't reach Docker Hub (mainland China)?** See **[docs/deploy.md → registry mirror](docs/deploy.md#国内构建加速docker-hub-常年不稳定)**.

### Which path?

| | Desktop App | Docker |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Personal use, Mac/Windows | NAS, server, 24/7 monitoring |
| **Setup** | Download + open | `docker compose up -d` |
| **Database** | SQLite (default) | Postgres (default; SQLite via `MEDIA_TRACK_SQLITE_PATH`) |
| **Agent API** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Always-on patrol** | ❌ (runs when app is open) | ✅ |
| **Multi-user** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Remote access** | Local only | Tailscale / Cloudflare Tunnel |

Both paths share **one codebase** — all product logic is identical. The data layer (SQLite vs Postgres) is selected by the `MEDIA_TRACK_SQLITE_PATH` env var, not the process shell — desktop sets it automatically, Docker defaults to Postgres.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Search → acquire** — find a title, hit 获取, the agent takes over | ![search](docs/images/search.png) |
| **Library wall** — what you have, per drive, with missing / airing badges | ![library](docs/images/library.png) |
| **Show detail** — season coverage, gaps, tracking state | ![show](docs/images/show.png) |
| **Realtime activity** — a live queue + agent action ticker while it works | ![activity](docs/images/activity.png) |
| **Notifications** — per-acquisition + daily digest, multi-channel push | ![notifications](docs/images/notifications.png) |
| **Settings** — drives, quality, language, LLM (BYO-key), Prowlarr, PanSou | ![settings](docs/images/settings.png) |

Multiple drives appear as a workspace switcher with per-brand icons:

## What it is

Most "media automation" either searches well but doesn't know what you're actually missing, or moves files but never verifies what landed. Mediary Scout treats acquisition as a **state problem**, driven by an agent that acts from evidence, not vibes:

- **Multi-drive, brand-extensible** — five drives today (Quark, 115, 光鸭 GuangYaPan, 123, 天翼 Tianyi), each a first-class workspace (a tree model: one account, many drives). Adding a new drive brand is a contained plugin.
- **Agent-driven selection** — the agent reads real search results and picks by quality preference, **HDR ladder** (DV > HDR10+ > HDR10 > SDR), **Chinese-subtitle** needs, and de-duplication, then verifies the transfer after it happens. Quality/HDR tokens never go in search keywords. Scheduled patrol stays gap-fill unless you enable an upgrade sweep — see [quality upgrade and HDR](docs/quality-upgrade-and-hdr.md).
- **Tracking & scheduled gap-fill** — season-level state machine; a scheduled sweep comes back only for shows that still have missing episodes.
- **Cloud-native** — it **transfers** shares/magnets straight into your drive (秒传 / save), it does not download to a local disk.

## Supported drives

Five Chinese cloud drives, each a first-class workspace — ordered by how many PanSou resources each can consume (115 and 123 are dual-path: own share links **and** magnets):

- **Quark / 夸克** (`quark`) — share-link transfer (no magnet web API). The largest share pool on PanSou by far.
- **123网盘** (`pan123`) — **dual-path like 115**: share-link transfer (`123pan.com/s/…`) **and** magnets via its native offline-download API (resolve → submit → poll). A magnet is a magnet — whether it came from PanSou or a Prowlarr indexer. QR login (~90-day token) or paste a token. Free accounts can transfer (server-side copy costs no download quota). **[Setup guide](docs/deploy.md#123网盘连接)**
- **115** (`pan115`) — full support: 115 share links **and** magnets (built-in offline path, plus Prowlarr).
- **GuangYaPan / 光鸭云盘** (`guangya`) — Xunlei-family drive; **magnet / offline-download only** (transfers magnet/ed2k/BT via its offline-task API — it does **not** transfer share links in v1). Token auth. Pairs well with Prowlarr. **[Setup guide](docs/deploy.md#光鸭云盘guangyapan连接)**
- **Tianyi / 天翼云盘** (`tianyi`) — share-link transfer (`cloud.189.cn/t/…`); QR login or paste an SSON cookie. Smallest share pool on PanSou today (weak for movies, workable for shows/anime). **[Setup guide](docs/deploy.md#天翼云盘连接)**

Measured share volume per drive (2026-07 point-in-time sample: six popular titles across movie / drama / anime, one PanSou instance with curated channels — your channels will vary):

| Drive | Own share links | Magnets it can also eat | Usable pool |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Quark | 523 | — | **523** |
| 123 | 120 | 361 | **481** |
| 115 | 100 | 361 | **461** |
| 光鸭 | — | 361 | **361** |
| 天翼 | 63 | — | **63** |

New brands plug into a storage-brand registry; the bulk of adding one is a drive client + a storage executor for that drive's transfer API.

## Agent API (agent-first control)

Both the desktop app and the container expose a local HTTP API that lets any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, …) operate Mediary Scout without opening the GUI — change settings, trigger acquisitions, check download progress.

**Desktop**: automatic — on first launch the app writes a discovery file to `~/.mediary/agent.json`. **Container**: set `MEDIA_TRACK_AGENT_TOKEN` env var to opt in.

Install the agent skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/ && cp -r skills/mediary-scout ~/.claude/skills/      # or ~/.codex/skills/, ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

Then tell your agent things like "帮我找进击的巨人第二季" or "蜘蛛侠下好了吗" or "把画质改成 high". See [`skills/mediary-scout/SKILL.md`](skills/mediary-scout/SKILL.md) for the full trigger list.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/agent/config` | Read settings (secrets masked) |
| `PUT` | `/api/agent/config` | Partial update (rejects masked `***` writes) |
| `POST` | `/api/agent/acquire` | Search TMDB → queue (409 on ambiguity) |
| `POST` | `/api/agent/patrol` | Trigger a patrol sweep |
| `GET` | `/api/agent/library` | Tracked titles + missing episodes |
| `GET` | `/api/agent/activity` | Active queue + recent notifications |

All require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. No token configured → `404` (invisible). Wrong/missing token → `401`.

## Architecture

A web app enqueues work; a long-running worker drives a sandboxed agent that has narrow, audited powers while the deterministic workflow owns every side effect and re-reads real state to verify.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI["Web UI<br/>(Next.js)"] -->|enqueue| Q["Postgres / SQLite<br/>+ run state"]
    Q --> W["In-process worker"]
    W --> AG["V2 sandbox agent"]
    AG -->|search| SRC["PanSou / Prowlarr"]
    AG -->|transfer| DR["Quark / 115 / 光鸭 / 123 / 天翼 drive"]
    AG -->|read back| DR
    AG -->|verify + mark| Q
    Q -->|realtime| UI
    CRON["Scheduled sweep"] -->|gaps only| Q
```

- State lives in **Postgres** (container) or **SQLite** (desktop) — runs are resumable across restarts (the agent rebuilds from real drive + DB state, not cached chat history).
- Metadata comes from **TMDB** (with a built-in proxy fallback so it works out of the box); resource search from **PanSou** and optionally **Prowlarr** (torrent/magnet indexers).

## Demo

**🔭 Try it live: [demo.mediaryscout.app](https://demo.mediaryscout.app)**

A public, **read-only** demo — mock drives, real TMDB search across the whole catalog, and a scripted acquisition you can watch land in the library. No drive connect, no transfers, nothing persists.

## Deploy (Docker)

Self-host on a NAS, a router (软路由), a spare PC, or a VPS — and reach it from your phone / TV via **Tailscale** or a **Cloudflare Tunnel** (no public IP needed; never expose `:3000` raw). Full walkthrough: **[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md)**.

### Deploy with an agent

Prefer to have an AI agent walk you through it? Paste this prompt:

````markdown
You are deploying Mediary Scout, a self-hosted media-acquisition agent. Follow the repo's docs/deploy.md. Ask the user the questions below IN ORDER, then execute.

## MUST ask (don't start without answers)
1. **Where are you deploying?** Which machine (NAS / router / spare PC / VPS), and how do I operate it — SSH in, or run commands on its local terminal?
2. **Single-user or multi-user?** Default single-user (just you). Multi-user lets family/friends each register, bind their own drives, and keep separate libraries.

## SHOULD ask (have defaults, but confirm preference)
3. **Local-only, or reach it from outside?**
   - Local network only (default — open `http://<host>:3000` from devices on the same LAN)
   - Tailscale (private mesh — recommended for home; no public IP, auto-encrypted)
   - Cloudflare Tunnel (public HTTPS like `https://media.yourdomain.com` — needs a domain on Cloudflare + Access in front)
4. **Configure real acquisition now, or just get it running first?** Real acquisition needs a supported drive (Quark/115/光鸭/123/天翼) + an LLM endpoint (OpenAI-compatible) + (if using 115) 115 directory CIDs. Skipping means it boots and you can look around, configure later in Settings.

## OPTIONAL — one question, skip all if the user doesn't care
5. Any of these you want to set up now? Reply "none" to skip and use defaults:
   - Push notifications (Bark / Server酱 / WeChat Work / webhook)
   - Your own TMDB key (default: works out of the box via the author's proxy)
   - Prowlarr magnet aggregation (115 only)
   - Build acceleration (registry mirror + npm mirror — needed in mainland China)

## Then execute
- `git clone https://github.com/fancydirty/mediary-scout && cd mediary-scout`
- If build acceleration (mainland China): `docker compose build --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com` + a registry mirror in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, **before** the first `up`
- `docker compose up -d` (first build takes a few minutes)
- If multi-user: add `MEDIA_TRACK_MULTI_USER=1` to `.env`, then `docker compose up -d web`
- If Cloudflare Tunnel: follow docs/deploy.md §"方式二" — create the tunnel in the Zero Trust dashboard, put the token in `.env` as `TUNNEL_TOKEN=<your-token>`, `docker compose --profile tunnel up -d`, and **add Cloudflare Access** (never expose the instance without auth)
- Open `http://<host>:3000`, walk the user through Settings (drive / LLM / optional extras)
- Verify it's up, report the URL, and tell them how to upgrade (`git pull && docker compose up -d --build`)
````

> **Disclaimer.** Mediary Scout is **open-source, self-hosted software**. It is **not** offered, and never will be offered, as a hosted service — you run your own instance and bring your own drive / LLM / metadata credentials. It performs the same kinds of file operations you could do by hand in your own cloud drive. See [docs/distribution-and-legal-positioning.md](docs/distribution-and-legal-positioning.md) for the project's stance.

## Status & limitations

- Self-hosted, for advanced users; you need usable access to a supported drive (Quark/115/光鸭/123/天翼 — a membership is most practical on 115/夸克; 123/天翼 work on free accounts).
- Scheduled monitoring is most valuable on an always-on host (Docker path).
- This is not a hosted product and ships no hosted backend.
