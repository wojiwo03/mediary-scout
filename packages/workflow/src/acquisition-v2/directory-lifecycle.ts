 * Phase 7a — directory lifecycle. Before the agent runs, the system ensures the
 * 115 directory tree exists and hands the agent scoped handles. Every level is
 * verify-or-create: a directory the DB thinks exists may have been deleted by
 * the user, so we go through createDirectory (find-or-create) which lists the
 * parent for the name and reuses it if present, recreates it if gone. The cid is
 * never trusted blindly — the directory is verified like a resource is.
 *
 * Staging lives UNDER the show directory, never inside a Season directory (a
 * recursive lister would otherwise leak isolated files as "obtained").

 * reportNoCoverage'd and finished, leaving 335 transferred files in staging).
 * removeDirectory is idempotent: if the agent already discarded, the "already gone"
 * error is swallowed so cleanup never masks the real result. It only ever touches
 * THIS run's ephemeral staging dir — never a Season/library dir.
 *
 * Bounded: a hung delete must not leave the run `running` after finish already
 * wrote 「正在收尾」. Timeout still lets the delete continue in the background.
