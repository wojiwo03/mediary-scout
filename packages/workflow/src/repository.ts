 *    2. Each backend's `upsertWorkflowRun` — catches every path, but is three
 *       edits and touches every persistence test fixture.
 *  `validateWorkflowRunSnapshot` is NOT viable: it runs on only 2 of the 7 upsert
 *  paths per backend (save + reserve), so it would miss expire/claim/recover/
 *  progress/retry entirely.
 *  Left as follow-up. Note the invariant currently holds with no gaps — of the
 *  five non-validated paths, expire writes `failed`, claim writes `running`,
 *  progress does not touch status, and recover/retry are both guarded.
 *  The `=== true` is load-bearing, not superstition: runs are persisted as JSON and
 *  read back with an unchecked `as WorkflowRun` cast, so a row written by another
 *  version can carry an unknown `kind`. Such a kind reads back `undefined` and is
