/**
 * Deterministic guardrails for the planning agents' searchResources tool.
 *
 * The Mimo model does not reliably obey "be economical" prompt guidance — a
 * single TV/anime planning loop was observed issuing 16 PanSou searches, most
 * of them trivial keyword variants of one another. Each PanSou call costs
 * ~10-25s, so the thrash dominated wall-clock time.
 *
 * Two guardrails enforced at the tool boundary (the model cannot override
 * them, unlike prompt text):
 *  - DEDUP: a keyword already searched this run returns the prior snapshot
 *    without re-hitting the provider. This is loss-free — re-searching the same
 *    keyword yields the same candidates — and removes the dominant time cost.
 *  - BUDGET: a generous cap on the number of DISTINCT searches per run, so even
 *    a thrashing model cannot burn unbounded provider calls. Set well above the
 *    handful of genuinely-useful keyword variants (title, aliases, original
 *    title, source-material name, a media-type/quality-prefixed retry), so it
 *    never truncates legitimate coverage searching — it only stops the thrash.
