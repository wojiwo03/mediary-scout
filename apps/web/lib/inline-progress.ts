 * at one value for most of the run, reading as "empty / no progress" (measured: a real
 * movie run spent 94 of 193s frozen at 11% during search).
 *
 * Between server updates the client trickles the bar forward: it eases from the last
 * server percent toward a soft ceiling just above it (decelerating, asymptotic — never
 * reaching), so a long opaque step shows continuous life WITHOUT claiming completion or
 * crossing the next real milestone. The caller anchors on the last server percent and
 * takes max(serverPercent, trickle), rebasing when the server value increases, so the
 * displayed bar is always monotonic (never rewinds). Pure + monotonic in `elapsedMs`.
